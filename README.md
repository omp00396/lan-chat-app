Every day millions of people are exchanging messages via messaging or rather chat
Applications (Apps). However, users do not know what happens to the messages once they
have been sent. Initially, encryption was considered to be used only by paranoid users or
people with a heightened need for secrecy. After the revelations of Edward Snowden,
consumers have become more aware of online privacy and the dangers of digital scooping of
data and identity theft. Surveillance activities are increasing globally and concerns amongst
people all over the world has been raised considerably whilst data retention laws are being
implemented (Ali, 2017). We live in a digital age where surveillance and data logging occur
on almost all our communication. Companies want to collect as much as possible personal
information about consumers. Some governments are hacking mobile devices to gain
unauthorised access for surveillance and other unknown reasons (Curran, 2018). Recently, the
Russian government requested the chat Application Telegram, on several occasions, to give
them the encryption keys of citizens registered on the chat Application. Although Telegram
did not comply, they are now at risk of being banned in Russia (Caffo, 2018). Although
messaging Apps have been around for a number of years, the development of secure mobile
Apps are increasing, focusing on securing the privacy of users and meeting their demands
(Corpuz, 2017; Das, 2017). Recent studies show that users are becoming concerned about
protecting privacy on their smartphones and opposed apps that collected their contacts
(Balebako et al., 2013). One survey of 2, 245 US adults showed that 57% of all smartphone
app users have either deleted an app or refused to install an app for security and privacy reasons
(Boyles et al. 2012).
Since consumers demand better security and privacy in messaging Apps, software
development companies have been attempting to address these issues. One of the features was
to launch end-to end-encryption (see Figure 1). End-to-end encryption refers to when
messages are encrypted during transmission and no copy is stored unencrypted on the servers
of the service providers. Nobody apart from the people communicating can view these
messages party; no third party, not even the government or the developers of these Apps.
Communication is transmitted using a secret code rather than plain text
In an age where the security of digital communication takes precedence, the imperative of
deploying robust encryption mechanisms cannot be overstated. This report serves as a

comprehensive exploration into the intricacies of AES 256-bit encryption, specifically
examining its application in fortifying communication within a local area network (LAN)
through a dedicated chat application. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the
safeguarding of sensitive information becomes a paramount concern, and AES emerges as a
stalwart guardian, recognized for its formidable strength and reliability.
AES 256-Bit Encryption: A Pillar of Data SecurityAt the heart of this exploration is AES, the Advanced Encryption Standard, which has solidified
its position as a cornerstone in data security. Its reputation for providing an impregnable
defense against cyber threats is a result of its robust algorithm, and this report aims to delve
into the intricate details of the AES 256-bit variant. With a focus on understanding the nuances
of encrypting and decrypting messages within the realm of a LAN-based chat platform, the
report endeavors to unravel the complexities associated with implementing AES 256-bit
encryption.
The Growing Need for Advanced Encryption TechniquesIn a world where digital interactions are witnessing an unprecedented surge, there is a growing
need for a comprehensive understanding and adept application of advanced encryption
techniques. The motivation is clear â€“ ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive
conversations. This report recognizes the imperative of not just acknowledging the prevalence
of cyber threats but also actively engaging with robust solutions to counter them. As such, the
application of AES 256-bit encryption within a LAN-based chat environment emerges as a
critical step towards fortifying the security of these interactions.
