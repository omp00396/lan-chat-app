# SecureChat App - AES-256 Encryption

## Overview
SecureChat is a chat application designed with a focus on security and privacy. This app employs the AES-256 encryption algorithm to ensure end-to-end encryption of messages, making it a secure communication platform.

## Features
- **End-to-End Encryption:** All messages exchanged within the app are encrypted using the AES-256 algorithm, providing a high level of security.
- **User Authentication:** Users are required to authenticate themselves to access the chat, ensuring that only authorized individuals can participate in conversations.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** A user-friendly interface makes it easy for users to navigate the app and engage in secure conversations.

## Encryption Algorithm
The app utilizes the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a key length of 256 bits. This symmetric encryption algorithm ensures that messages are secure during transmission and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.

## Getting Started
To use the SecureChat app, follow these steps:

1. **Installation:** Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/securechat.git
    cd securechat
    npm install
    ```

2. **Configuration:** Set up the app with your preferred configurations, including server settings and authentication mechanisms.

3. **Run the App:** Start the app to begin secure communication.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. **Invite Users:** Share the app with your friends and colleagues, and invite them to join your secure chat community.

## Security Considerations
- **Key Management:** Ensure secure key management practices to protect encryption keys from unauthorized access.
- **Regular Audits:** Periodically review and audit the codebase and dependencies for potential security vulnerabilities.
